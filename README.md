- 👋 Hi, I’m @G10io-R-Official; call me Gio! ;-) :-D =3
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Everything related with the Electronics Engineering, I know how to program in Java, C, Pascal (a little bit out of practice XD), basics in 
- python, and assembler; I know how to set up the routers for static routing IP's and the dynamic form, with the protocols RIP and OSPF. Everything I learned in my BSc.
- I'm more in love with the Digital Electronics, Data Communication, all the Calculus (since I to Integral Transforms) and Electric Circuits, but I love any other topic
- such as Telecommunication, Analog Electronics and Control&Automation. I know Spanish language, and English.

- 📫 How to reach me ...  I'll update my Social Networks later, as I'm a little bit busy by the moment. I'm going to put my IG, fb, Discord, to contact me later, and 
- my YT channel to watch some videos related with the topics I mentioned before, and some tutorials and other content. So contact me through the comments in my repo,
- please. Thank you so much for reading me! :D Hugs and keep safe anyone reading this!
